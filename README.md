# Semantic-Segmentation-of-Dental-Images
In this project propose a segmentation system based on mask region- based convolutional neural network to accomplish an instance segmentation. Performance was thoroughly assessed from a 1500 challenging image data set, with high variation and containing 10 categories of different types of buccal image.
